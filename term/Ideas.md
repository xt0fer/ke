# Term support ideas

- https://github.com/Azure/go-ansiterm.git (has pretty small parser of keys to commands)
- https://github.com/google/goterm.git ( maybe a simple google inout handler (maybe only linux?))
- https://github.com/buger/goterm ( output side, no input machinery)
- https://github.com/Nerdmaster/terminal (Output-agnostic readline-like package for any io.Reader(SSH, local terminals, etc))
- https://github.com/exyzzy/termfun (TermFun is a package to do some fun things in your Go Terminal)
- https://github.com/jaguilar/vt100 (An raw-mode vt100 screen reader; produces a vt100 in an html file)
  - maybe used for a browser-based display?
- https://pkg.go.dev/fyne.io/fyne/v2 (maybe a simple golanf UI toolkit)
- https://github.com/creack/termios (hmm, very simple for termios to raw mode)

### Piecetables

- https://github.com/sparkeditor/piece-table/blob/master/index.js (a pretty simple piece table)
